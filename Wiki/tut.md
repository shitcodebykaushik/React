- We need react for the complex frontend .
- React was created for the Phantom message. Which was the issue of the facebook .
- State is maintained by the js . State is faincy name of the variable .
- UI is maintained by the DOM . 
- There was the issue of the sync between UI and State . To solve this issue react js was created .
- Khan academy and Unplash adopted this at the first and they have appriciated it lot .
- Watch inner working of the dom .
- Go in depth method and then go for the project .
- Babel ,Fibre, VirtualDOM , diffing algo hydration ,.Tree shaking are the depth of the reactjs .
- React is the a library . 
 - Framework is military where is strict rule  and type safety .
 - Library is cool dude  where is there is no hard and strict rule of it .

- Topic to learn 
  - Core of react (state or UI manipulation,JSX).
  - Component Reability .
  - Reusing of component (Props) [Props means the property of the object];
  - How to propgate change (hooks). 
- React make SPA (Single page application),which means page are nor reloaded . But we
- There is no router in the reactjs .
- By defualt there was no state management . Redux,Toolkit,zustand ,context API .
- React is fucntion based component .
- BAAS Apps . Backend as a service . 
- Reactjs is not the complete solution as it not perfect for  SEO .
- Browser rendring issue of the of the reacthjs .
- Next js remix is the next solution for the these issue  .
# Creating project
- Npm is the node package manager .
- npx is the node package executor 
- npx create-react-app 01basicreact .
- Then move to that project to view the package that file .'
- Under the node.json file we see the web-vitals which measure the performance of the site and to track the performance .
- We will see the scripts to which run the project and build the production things .
- eslinting is use to see the error .
- browser list the working browser .
-  There is difference between npm run and npm  start , so intially we should run the project  with the npm run to avoid the exception .
- npm build is serve to the production user . Here you can find the user ready file size and deploy to the end user .
- Create is the utility .
- Dev dependicies doesn't go into the production , It only go to the development .
 # Level 1
  - `<h1></h1>` This is the heading on a web-page  and there is heading level of these things .h1 is the top level things and h6 is for the lowest level .
  - If we want action on any button then we can write the onclick method .
  - React control the UI updation .
  - `Hook`
     -  Hooks are the functions that is use to use state and other React features without writing the class .
- <Container>
  - A container is the reusable peice of the code that encapsulated specific functionality or ui structure .
    - There are pre built components (Buttons and imqnge and view)
    - There are customs components .

- <View> 
   - A view is the container for laying out child components and it is similiar to the <div> in the web development .
   - It is used to build the structure of the app . 
   - It is container that holds other components .
   - View is for the static content  .
   - In short smjho view ik fix box area leta h and the uske andr specific area dekr  chizo ko design krta hai .

- <ScrollView>
  -  This is for the dynamic content and it disadvantage is that it wont perform well with the more complext data .

- <Image>

- <ScrollView>
   - A scrollable container for displaying long list or views 
   - Can handle both vertical and the horizontal scrolling 
- <Flatlist>
   - Optimized for displaying larger datasets efficently.
   - Supports lazy loading and performance optimization 
- <Touchable>

  - TouchableOpacity reduce opacity on press 
  - Touchable Highlight Add a background color on press .
- <Text input>
   - Used for uset input like forms and search bars 
- <Buttons>
  - A simple button for user actions 
- <SafeAreaView> 
  - Ensure content doesn't overlap with the system UI area like noches and the status bars .
- <Modal>

- <SectionList> 
  - Similiar to flatlist but for grouped data .
- <Picker>
  - A dropdown selctor for choosing items 
- <Animated >

- <Checkbox> 
  -  A toggleable for checkbox input 
- <Slider>
  - A slider for selcetion a value within a range 
- <statusbar>
  - Manages the appearance of the device status baar
  - statusbar is the topmost part of the screen on the mobile device showing system related information .

- <Flexbox> 
  - A flexbox  is powerful layout system that allows you to control the arrangement of the child components inside a container .
  - It simply determine how much space child should have .
  - Flex 1 means take up all the available space .
  - Flex n represent the propotional share available space the component should occupy compared to its siblings .
  Eg if the `flex: 1` and the another has the `flex:2` then the second will have take the twice as musch space as the first .
- React Native is not strictly based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture . Instead React native follows a components based architure that is closer to the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- JSX stands for the jacascript xml which  helpd to code html like code in javascript to define how app should look like .
- Component are resuable piece of the code  view text button are the pre-built one .
- Functional components are known as the stateless components. It accept the props and return the HTML 
- Class componetns are know as the stateful components 
- npm install react-navigation
- State holds dynamic private data for a component , its mutable and local to the component and most use case is  that it changes over time .
- Props hold data passed from a parent component these are immuatable passed from parents to the child componetns , used for static components 
- In simple term state is the memory of the components .
- `npx react-native run-android`
- `npx react-native run-ios.` 
- `expo start` 

- Functional componets are writeen in the Javascript functions 
- Class components are written as ES6 classes they uses the lifecycle methods.
# Virtual DOM 
-  At the present we dont use much part of the virtual dom .
- Inside the virtual dom we tack the entire change and trace the change with the tree like structure .
- Create root create the full dom behind the scene , 
  - Browser do the rebuilding of the dom thats why there is refresh time .
  - There is virtual dom but we use the Fiber algorithm .
# Tailwind 
- make project and go inside the project .
- run this command 
- Edit the config file .
