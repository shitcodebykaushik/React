-  NativeScript is an open-source framework for building native mobile applications for iOS and Android using JavaScript, TypeScript, or frameworks like Angular and Vue.js. 

- A NativeScript application consists of several different layer 
  - JavaScript/TypeScript Layer: Where business logic is implemented.
  - NativeScript Runtime: Bridges the JavaScript code with the native APIs.
  - Native Layer: The actual code that runs on the device using native components.
  - App Modules: The entry point of the application.
  - Page Modules: Represent individual screen
  - View Components: Widgets that represent UI elements.
